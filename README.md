# keypress-timing

Running this program will show you how long you have hit each key for. I created this to determine a good value for autoshift on my [Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/).

## Issues

If you press a key then hit shift and then release it (or the other way around) the program will crash. I don't feel like fixing this since it's not a big deal for my usage.

## Dependencies

`pynput`
